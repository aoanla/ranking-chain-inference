These are the main rating engines for SRDRank v2.2
The difference is that the batch version calculates ratings for the entire history to the point you want to stop at.
Both combine Least-squares regression with a statistical test to pick up rapidly changing teams (and split them appropriately).

The output on the website also depends on:

parse_fts_csv_2.py		

a support script to process FTS records into our tools, and perform graph analysis of them.

ztest.py

a support script to perform statistical tests on teams for divergence (using z-tests)

process-teams.py

a support script which outputs properly generated team data, including geolocation (map coordinates) for each team.

This location will contain the infrastructure for SRD Rank v2.0



This is currently under development, and will probably combine multiple ranking mechanisms to improve tracking.
 - further with with Massey-style least-squares fits, and optimisation, suggests possibilities for optimising the fits to spring-method levels of efficiency.
 - benefit of the above is that lsq fits are both faster than spring-model energy minimisation, and also give us an intrinsic measure of confidence for ratings.
 - (spring model confidences exist, but are inferred from graph theory, rather than estimated directly from the fit - we can combine both approaches for 
 -    a more nuanced view of the relationship between teams. )

The output html will also be improved for UX.

 - several "prettification" requests have been made, which increase page weight slightly
 - layout tweaks needed
 - improved power of selectors (group selectors etc), which need javascript 
 - - two versions of html (css-clean and javascript"enhanced", so security conscious can still use the old versions)
 - rewording of table columns, other help for understanding output
