This is the full set of workflow tools needed to generate SRD Rank pages.

The system is a bit... bitty... at the moment, due to the way in which it was developed.

The core tools are the process-from-FTS... files, which are all Python code which performs various kinds of inference on the FTS datasets given to it.
They all use the "library" tools in parse-from-fts.py 
(They need: flattrackstats-*.csv files, for team, bouts and tournaments, which are available from FTS on request.
This FTS data is licensed under a CC:BY-NC-SA licence, and so we distribute copies of the dumps from near the end of 2016 for use and testing.)

the other tools, which are mostly bash scripts, perform post-processing on the output of the process-from-FTS tools (which are predicted ratings generated by an optimisation process)
to generate the SRD Rank html pages.

More documentation on the workflow later.
