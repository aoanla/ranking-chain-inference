This is the full set of workflow tools needed to generate SRD Rank pages.

The system is a bit... bitty... at the moment, due to the way in which it was developed.

The core tools are the process-from-FTS... files, which are all Python code which performs various kinds of inference on the FTS datasets given to it.
They all use the "library" tools in parse-from-fts.py 
(They need: flattrackstats-*.csv files, for team, bouts and tournaments, which are available from FTS on request.
This FTS data is licensed under a CC:BY-NC-SA licence, and so we distribute copies of the dumps from near the end of 2016 for use and testing.)

the other tools, which are mostly bash scripts, perform post-processing on the output of the process-from-FTS tools (which are predicted ratings generated by an optimisation process)
to generate the SRD Rank html pages.

* make-full-ranking

Takes processed output from process-from-FTS-spring (and process-from-FTS-confidences) and generates an html representation of the rating and ranking. (Expects a previous rating from a previous time period in order to generate the
columns for change in rating / ranking and the last one.)

 - relies on ghostrank , which is the tool which generates those deltas.

* makeranking

Takes in rating from the process-from-FTS-spring and generates appropriate rankings.


More documentation on the workflow later.


* process-from-FTS-mapper


* process-from-FTS-sizer


* process-from-FTS-spring	

Core spring-based physical rating algorithm. Needs to be configured for input files, and given ranges to take bout data for, and eligible FTS genuses (W,M,C,J = Women, Men, Co-ed, Junior)
   also needs to specify if rating is drawn from score difference (diff) or score ratio (ratio)

* process-from-FTS-spring-confidences

Confidence-level generator for rating algorithm. Outputs only the spring-model confidences (which are derived from maximum flow / minimum cuts algorithm), along with the clique analysis via the same 
mechanism (sorts the rated set into subgroups, where all the teams in each subgroup are more closely connected to each other than the group is connected to the world).

* process-from-FTS-spring-seeded

Core spring-based physical rating algorithm, designed to read in a previous rating calculation as the basis for the calculation.
