Tools to do Geolocation on FTS team data.
The result is an "augmented" FTS datafile, which adds latitude and longitude fields to the csv.

Lookups are done against the Google Maps Geolocation API - you will need a (free) Google Services API key to use this.
(Lookups are also cached in the Geoloc-cache directory, which is provided here based on the run against the November dataset from FTS - 
 so lookups against the API are only needed for "new" locations.)

We also have a tool to calculate distances between two locations, in progress.

Due to the way FTS teams are stored, you need to run the denormaliser on the FTS csv first, to add info to the B Team entries (which otherwise just reference their A teams in the original file).
